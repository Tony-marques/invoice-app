## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwindcss - For styles
- Zustand - State Managment
- Formik

### What I learned

This was actually my first time using Formik, and a first time too with a form that consequent.
Even though i couldn't manage to use the Formik built-in for errors message display and add to create my own system for it, Formik
was actually great to use for handling form
